# E-commerce-Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Analysis
Performed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on over 50,000 customer transactions by using Python (Pandas, NumPy), enabling the segmentation of customers based on their purchasing behavior and improving targeted marketing strategies.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to uncover key customer trends and patterns, leading to data-driven insights used in customer retention planning.

Built a dynamic Power BI dashboard to visualize customer segments, transaction frequency, and revenue trends by product and region, providing business stakeholders with real-time, interactive insights.

Cleaned and transformed raw transactional data using Power Query and DAX in Power BI to prepare it for analysis, resulting in a 30% reduction in data processing time and improved accuracy of insights.

Created a customer segmentation model using RFM scoring logic, categorizing users into tiers like “Champions”, “Loyal Customers”, and “At Risk”, which enabled the business to personalize promotions and improve customer lifetime value (CLV).

Implemented filtering and drill-down functionality in Power BI to allow stakeholders to analyze customer behavior over time and across product categories, leading to more informed business decisions and improved campaign performance.

Automated the RFM calculation pipeline using Python scripts, allowing for scalable and repeatable analysis on new data, which reduced manual effort and ensured consistent insights delivery.

Presented project outcomes and dashboard walkthrough to stakeholders, explaining the RFM methodology, key findings, and actionable insights, which helped align marketing efforts with data-driven customer segmentation.
